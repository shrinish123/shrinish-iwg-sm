A repo created for the work of Institute Wellness Group, IIT Kharagpur


         1. NAVBAR : The navbar design should be  something like this : 
         
         ![navbar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56491104/91307575-c48a5980-e7cb-11ea-877e-b3e3873956f5.png)
         
         The link for the website from which it is suggested is : https://hellonesh.io/
         Just visit the websit for hover effects and overall UX.
         
         The particulars in the navbar :
         1. Home
         2. About Us
         3. Events
         4. Resources
         5. Contact Us
         
         Now in the navbar we see that there is a sign up button,
         wherein we can keep Freshers Section , so that when the newbies who dont know much about query pages in the beginning can visit the section
         For better understanding of this idea ,
         A similar freshers section is made here : http://bsw.iitd.ac.in/
         
         
         
         
         2. HOME : This is the opening page, so this shouldnt be filled with too much with animations and moving things ,as this will make it a slow website 
                    and mostly no one cares about the animations , but they mostly care a lot of the speed of the website,
                    Users will always want to visit a website which loads easily than a website that takes a lot time to load just to see your animation 
                    and css skills
                    
                    Also try  add a photo like https://kossiitkgp.org/ with minimum background and disturbance
                    
                    Here we should just add the aims and objectives on the page and a footer 
                
                
               
         3. ABOUT US : We can again go as koss have designed the about us section
         
                       But a creative way of making student cards would be like :  
                       
                       
                       The reference to this is here : https://www.instagram.com/p/CDjUrs1gHWM/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet
